Location History Analysis
=====

This was a quick project to look at my location history.

Location history exported from [Google](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0).
Polygons exported from [Google Maps Engine](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/u/0/?pli=1).

Entry point is the [Run object](https://github.com/balshor/location-history-analysis/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/leeriggins/location/Run.scala)
